//////////////////////////////////// Coding Challenge #2 ///////////////////////////

/* 
1. Re-create challenge 1, but this time using an Es6 class;

2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6);

3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6);

4. Create a new car and experiment with the accelerate and brake methods, and with the getter and setter.

DATA CAR 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
